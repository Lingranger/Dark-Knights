      <h2>What is Darts?</h2>
      <p>Darts is a precision sport where players throw small pointed missiles called darts at a circular target known as a dartboard. Itâ€™s enjoyed casually in pubs and competitively worldwide.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dartboard Layout</h2>
      <p>The dartboard consists of 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points each. The board is divided into single, double, and triple scoring areas, with a bullseye in the center worth 50 points for the inner bull and 25 for the outer bull.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Scoring System</h2>
      <p>Players aim to reduce their starting score, commonly 501 or 301, to exactly zero by hitting specific sections. Doubles and triples multiply the points scored in that segment. The game requires strategic aiming and precision.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Players take turns throwing three darts per round.</li>
        <li>A valid game typically starts with a score like 501; the goal is to reach zero points exactly.</li>
        <li>You must finish by hitting a double or the bullseye.</li>
        <li>If you reduce the score below zero, the round is lost, and the score resets to the previous total.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
      <p>Darts has a rich history and has evolved into a highly competitive sport with professional leagues, televised tournaments, and passionate fans worldwide.</p>
